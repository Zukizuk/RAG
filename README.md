# ChatRAGI

ChatRAGI is an AI-powered chatbot that leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide insightful and context-aware responses. Built with **LlamaIndex**, **Gemini AI**, and **Streamlit**, this application efficiently retrieves relevant information from a local dataset and generates intelligent responses. Check it out here [Link](https://zuki-rag.streamlit.app/)

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Q&A** – Uses Google's Gemini AI for intelligent responses.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Enhances responses by fetching relevant data.
- **Streaming Responses** – Provides real-time, token-by-token AI responses.
- **Persistent Storage** – Saves indexed data for faster retrieval.
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Built with Streamlit for an intuitive chat experience.

## 🛠️ Installation
